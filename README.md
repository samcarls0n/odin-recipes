# Odin Project Foundations - Recipe Website
My first official project for the Odin Project Foundations course.

This was a simple and easy project to build an html recipes website. I was able to utilize the lessons learned on the Git and Github section on the course. Although I had issues in pushing commit comments, I think my skills are improving.
